summary: Seminar at EURECOM, Biot, France
abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards. Traditional RL models often grapple with challenges like balancing exploration and exploitation, sparse rewards, and the need for extensive computational resources.

DeepSeek-R1 represents a significant advancement in RL by addressing these challenges. Released in January 2025, DeepSeek-R1 employs a "mixture of experts" architecture, comprising 671 billion parameters, with only a subset activated per task. This design enhances computational efficiency, allowing the model to operate effectively on less advanced hardware. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 was trained using pure reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning, relying on rule-based rewards to incentivize accurate reasoning and output formatting. This approach enables the model to self-improve through feedback, aligning closely with human-like learning processes.

The integration of these innovations positions DeepSeek-R1 as a paradigm shift in RL, offering a more efficient and autonomous framework for developing advanced AI systems.
